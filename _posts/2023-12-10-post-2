In just one month, our collective journey kicks off, and I'm buzzing with excitement to welcome each of you.

Your arrival marks the beginning of a new vibrant chapter. As we prepare to open the lab doors, I look forward to the exchange of ideas, skills, and creativity that will shape the lab's future.

Welcome aboard, new lab members! ðŸš€
