I am a Neuroengineering PhD student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Stemming from the world of Computer Science and Mathematics, I aspire to apply engineering principles into the field of neuroscience, particularly involving neuroprosthetics and brain machine interfaces (BMIs). I previously attended the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), where I obtained my bachelor's and master's.
