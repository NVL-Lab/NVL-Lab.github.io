Hello, my name is Madhumitha Ramesh but I go by Maddie. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in neuroscience at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), where I also serve as a Perioperative Services Care Technician at UAB Hospital Highlands. My passion lies in neuroscience and medicine, and at NVL I hope to gain experience to explore new approaches to patient care.
