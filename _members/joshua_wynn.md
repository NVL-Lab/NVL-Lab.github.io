I'm a Undergraduate at the University of Alabama at Birmingham(UAB) in Engineering Design with a minor in Neuroengineering and Electrical Engineering. I'm a member of the NVL lab to gain more experience within a Neuroengineering Lab and working with neuroprosthetics. My goal is to get experience with NVL to confidently enroll into a Neuroengineering PhD program. I have expertise in biomedical design, working with circuits, coding in C++ and Matlab, and 3D design.
