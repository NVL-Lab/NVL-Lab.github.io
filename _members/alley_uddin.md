My name is Alley Uddin. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I joined the NVL lab to be able to experience what it is like to work in a wet lab environment. I plan on using the skills learned in this lab to fuel my interest in neuroprosthetics and medicine.
