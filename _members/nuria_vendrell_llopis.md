I'm a neuroscientist and neuro-engineer fascinated by neuroprosthetic learning. My passion lies in crafting innovative neuro-stimulation approaches to artificially restore and enhance cognitive skills. I earned an equivalent  to a B.S. and M.S. degrees in Telecommunication Engineering from the UPV (Spain) in 2010, followed by a Ph.D. in Biomedical Science from KU Leuven (Belgium) in 2015.
